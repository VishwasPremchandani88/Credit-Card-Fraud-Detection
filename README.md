# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project aims to detect credit card fraud by employing machine learning algorithms, with a primary focus on Logistic Regression. The model has been trained and tested on a real-world dataset, achieving an accuracy of 92% on the training data and 89% on the test data.
# Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a crucial task for financial institutions to prevent unauthorized transactions. This repository provides a machine learning-based solution that effectively identifies fraudulent transactions, balancing accuracy with the need for generalizability.

# Features
Dataset: The project utilizes a real-world credit card transaction dataset, containing both fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
Preprocessing: Comprehensive data preprocessing includes handling class imbalance, normalizing features, and addressing any missing values.
Modeling: Logistic Regression is used as the main algorithm to classify transactions, chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.
Evaluation: The model demonstrates strong performance with an accuracy of 92% on training data and 89% on test data, highlighting its effectiveness while maintaining robustness.
Visualization: The repository includes visualizations like confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves to evaluate and interpret model performance.
# Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for the entire workflow.
Scikit-learn: For implementing Logistic Regression and model evaluation metrics.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: To create visualizations for understanding data distribution and model performance.
